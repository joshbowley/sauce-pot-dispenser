# sauce-pot-dispenser

An Arduino-based **smart sauce pot dispenser** that adjusts sauce flow and stirring based on user input. This project is designed to develop practical mechatronics and embedded systems skills while creating a functional kitchen device.

## Features

- User-interactive control panel with buttons and potentiometers
- Servo and stepper motors for controlled dispensing and stirring
- Adjustable flow rates and stirring speeds
- LEDs for user feedback
- Custom 3D-printed casing for electronics and mechanisms

## Hardware

- Arduino Uno / Mega
- Stepper motors
- Custom 3D-printed parts

## Software

- Arduino IDE (C++ based)
- Modular `.ino` file structure
- Uses standard Arduino libraries and servo/stepper control libraries

## Project Goals

- Gain hands-on mechatronics and embedded programming experience
- Build a fully functional, adjustable sauce dispenser prototype
- Practice version control and structured project documentation
